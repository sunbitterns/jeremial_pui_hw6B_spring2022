### Bonus
1  **Responsive Design**
    It's tot great, but somewhat there, specifically for the appointment booking pages where I used percentages instead of a fixed width. 
2. **Some interesting & useful JS functionality**
   I think one useful JS function I learned about
   was the sort function, which allowed me to 
   sort all the appointments by date and time, so that
   the most recent ones would display first. 
   (I also have some dead code in timeslots.js to 
   generate all the possible timeslots that a user
   could choose, but I didn't have time to make it
   pretty, so I omitted it.) 
3. **Add product pages for all your products**
   All user-added appointments have corresponding
   detail pages, and the user can delete and change them.
